 * Demonstrate using ImageIOLibrary loadImage and ImageGUI. Displays Baker tower and a black and white version side by side.
 * Use loadImage to read a graphic file (e.g., png, jpg) into memory stored in a BufferedImage
 * Use ImageGUI to display the image
 *      pass one image to the contructor to see just that image
 *      pass two imges to the constructor to see both images side by side (image1 then image2)
 *      can change images using setImage1 or setImage2
