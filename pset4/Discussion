Who would you recommend as good and bad Bacon, in terms of degree and in terms of
average separation. Justify, in comparison to others including Bacon himself.

A in terms of degree and average separation, a good Bacon would be: Gene Hackman. With the largest
number of out degrees (102) and the lowest average, it makes perfect sense that he is the most efficient, and
would therefore be an excellent center to optimize the program.

An example of a bad Bacon would be: John Howard. With an average  Separation of 5.65 and only 3 out degrees,
it's clear he is both not very connected and is on average very far from other actors.

Kevin bacon, with a Degree of 80 and an average separation of 3.28, is decidedly an efficient center, but
definitely not as good as Gene Hackman, and far better than John Howard. I'd argue Kevin Bacon is a decidedly top 80%
center, but he is beat out by a few choice well-known actors.

In all, a good bacon has both a large number of out degrees and a very small average separation.
